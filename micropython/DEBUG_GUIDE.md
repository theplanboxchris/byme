# Debugging Guide for BLE Peer Alert System

## Problem: No Activity Messages

Your devices are running but you can't see what's happening. The current code is **silent**.

## Solution: Add Logging Everywhere

We need to add `print()` statements to see:
1. âœ… Did the device start?
2. âœ… Is it advertising?
3. âœ… Did someone connect?
4. âœ… Did it receive keywords?
5. âœ… Is it scanning?
6. âœ… Did it find other devices?
7. âœ… Did keywords match?

## How to Debug

### **Step 1: Connect to ESP32 Serial Console**

```bash
# Watch real-time output
mpremote connect COM3 repl
```

You'll see all print() statements in real-time.

### **Step 2: Run the Code**

```bash
mpremote connect COM3 run micropython/main.py
```

The console should show detailed logging.

### **Step 3: Look for These Key Messages**

**Expected output (Device 1):**
```
[INIT] BLE initializing...
[INIT] âœ… Writer registered (GATT server ready)
[INIT] âœ… Scanner ready (GATT client ready)
[ADV] Advertising as: NIMI_PEER_ALERT
[SCAN] Starting scan cycle...
[SCAN] Found 1 peer(s)
[SCAN] Connecting to peer...
[SCAN] âœ… Connected to peer
[SCAN] Reading peer keywords...
[SCAN] Got peer keywords: ["pizza", "tacos"]
[LOCAL] Our keywords: ["pizza", "sushi"]
[ALERT] âœ… MATCH FOUND: pizza
ðŸ”´ LED blink 3x + BUZZER beep
```

## What's Missing in Current Code

The current files have **minimal logging**. Here's what to add:

### **In `main.py`:**
- Print when BLE starts
- Print when services register
- Print advertising status
- Print async loop running

### **In `modality_write.py`:**
- Print when connected/disconnected
- Print when data received
- Print when file saved
- Print when notification sent

### **In `modality_peer.py`:**
- Print scan start/stop
- Print peers found
- Print connection attempts
- Print keywords compared
- Print match alerts

## Common Issues & How to Spot Them

| Issue | What You'll See | Fix |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| BLE not started | No output at all | Check `ble.active(True)` |
| Services not registered | No "registered" message | Check UUID format |
| Not advertising | No "Advertising" message | Check `gap_advertise()` |
| Scan not working | No "scan" messages | Check `gap_scan()` |
| Can't find peers | "Found 0 peers" | Check device names match |
| Connection fails | "Failed to connect" | Check distance/interference |
| Keywords not received | No "write" message | Check Web Bluetooth or sender |
| No match alerts | Keywords found but no alert | Check keyword comparison |

## Next Steps

I will create **enhanced versions** of all 4 files with detailed logging.
You'll replace the current files with these debug versions and see exactly what's happening.
